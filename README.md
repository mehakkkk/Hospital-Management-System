# Hospital-Mangement-System

The project Hospital Management system includes registration of patients,
storing their details into the system along with their history. The software
has the facility to give a unique id for every patient and store the details of
every patient and the staff automatically. Our system is divided into three
parts namely the Receptionist, the Doctor and the Administrator.

Receptionist will be responsible for registering the patient, he/she can also
view the basic information about the employees and the patient.
Doctors can add/view the patient history along with the status of the patient
being admitted or not for a specific duration. Doctors can also check his/her
records.

Administrator will be the head of the system including all the rights from
deleting an employee to adding one. Entire information of the hospital will
be made available to the administrator.
